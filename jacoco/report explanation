Week 3 Report

As shown in the coverage report, all the code I implemented
for the Week 3 alerts has achieved 100% code coverage.
Moving forward, I will continue writing additional tests
for the remaining parts of the system to ensure that all
other files also achieve full test coverage and functionality.
